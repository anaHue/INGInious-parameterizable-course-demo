# INGInious-parameterizable-course-demo

This project is a proof of concept for an [INGInious](https://github.com/INGInious/INGInious) course with variable parameters. By defining a variable parameter, you can bring modularity to your course files, making it easier to rewrite an exercise. This comes with a visual interface from this [PR](https://github.com/INGInious/INGInious/pull/1048). The visual interface helps you to configure parameters values of your course
